# DRBD & Keepalived

This is a writeup for a DRBD & Keepalived project by my professor Mr Noureddine grassa.
it implements a simple **2-node High Availability (HA) cluster** using:
- **DRBD** for real-time block-level replication
- **Keepalived** (VRRP) for Virtual IP failover
- **Nginx** to show which node is currently active and to share local files

> This section documents the exact steps I performed to build the DRBD + Keepalived HA cluster.
> For each step I include the commands I ran, what to check, and a placeholder for a screenshot.
