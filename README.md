# DRBD & Keepalived

This is a writeup for a DRBD & Keepalived project by my professor Mr Noureddine grassa.
it implements a simple **2-node High Availability (HA) cluster** using:
- **DRBD** for real-time block-level replication
- **Keepalived** (VRRP) for Virtual IP failover
- **Nginx** to show which node is currently active and to share local files

### 1 - Preparation

What I did here is basically set up a custom network adapter in order for the DRBD to run and operate smoothly like shown in the screenshot bellow
